The apk of the game can be found in Builds folder.

How to play the game:
Once the game opens, the camera also opens. Scan a plain surface for a few seconds(scan the surface by moving the phone left,right,forward,backward). After a few seconds a blue circle should appear on the scanned surface.
Now, when you click 'spawn' button for the first time, the hero spawns. Afterwards, each time the 'spawn' button is clicked, an enemy appears. Use the punch and kick buttons to attack the enemies and score points.
